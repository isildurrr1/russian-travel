              <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
                but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country. Like, why are we here, at home,
                did not see? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, thick
                Sayan forests and severe ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can see all these beauties without
                millions in the account, passports and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova
                - a brave young mother, who took three children in an armful, seated them in her Lada
                and traveled 20 thousand kilometers in her native country. We have selected and described some
                interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

                    First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes,
                    strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open in the car
                    windows, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - mountain
                    air.</p>
                  <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so go here
                    best in summer. So you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna.
                    Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and on the plains
                    deer graze. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

                      to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. March 2019
                      at the festival "Baikal Mile" a world record was set - 197.011 km / h.</p>
